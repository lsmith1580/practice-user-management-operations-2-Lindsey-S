I learned how to perform JOINS, LEFT JOINS, and how to use SubQueries and 
GROUP BY statements on two tables that have a common id of customer_id. Using 
these, I was able to sort and combine the data based on various parameters such 
as total order amount, customers last names, and customer count. The most 
challenging aspect was coming up with adequate examples of each type of query 
as well as understanding exactly what is happening when each of those queries 
are made.
